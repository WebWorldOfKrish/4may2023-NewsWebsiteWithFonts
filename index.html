            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal

            Holding simultaneous elections would be ideal as well as desirable, but a workable formula is required to be provided in the Constitution, the Law Commission of India concluded in its draft report in August 2018, citing detailed discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has supported the idea and projected logistical and financial requirements for conducting simultaneous elections. It added the ECI’s analysis of financial implications, logistical issues, the effect of the Model Code of Conduct, and constitutional and legal provisions point to the fact that there is a feasibility of restoring simultaneous elections as they existed during the first two decades of independence.

            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal. The panel will explore the feasibility and the mechanism of going back to having Lok Sabha and state assembly polls simultaneously. These polls were held together until 1967.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Law Commission called for appropriately addressing the issues of democracy, basic structure, federalism, etc. “Care has also been taken to ensure that the rights of the citizens are not compromised in any manner. Free and fair election is an essential part of a democracy. Even today, premature dissolution of House(s) and mid-term polls are frequent in the country.”
