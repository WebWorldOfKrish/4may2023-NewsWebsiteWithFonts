        <img src="./img/1.png">
        <p>
            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal
        </p>
        <p>
            Holding simultaneous elections would be ideal as well as desirable, but a workable formula is required to be provided in the Constitution, the Law Commission of India concluded in its draft report in August 2018, citing detailed discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has supported the idea and projected logistical and financial requirements for conducting simultaneous elections. It added the ECI’s analysis of financial implications, logistical issues, the effect of the Model Code of Conduct, and constitutional and legal provisions point to the fact that there is a feasibility of restoring simultaneous elections as they existed during the first two decades of independence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal. The panel will explore the feasibility and the mechanism of going back to having Lok Sabha and state assembly polls simultaneously. These polls were held together until 1967.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Law Commission called for appropriately addressing the issues of democracy, basic structure, federalism, etc. “Care has also been taken to ensure that the rights of the citizens are not compromised in any manner. Free and fair election is an essential part of a democracy. Even today, premature dissolution of House(s) and mid-term polls are frequent in the country.”

        <img src="./img/3.png">
        <p>Special Parliament session will be held in both the old and the new buildings. On Ganesh Chaturthi, the sitting will shift to the new Parliament building.</p>
        <p>Amid intense political speculations over the five-day special session of Parliament from September 18 to 22, it has now been reported that the session will begin in the old building and will later be moved to the new Parliament building on September 19, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, news agency ANI reported citing sources. The special session of Parliament has caught the parties off guard as the government has not given any agenda for the 5-day sitting. Congress parliamentary party chief Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is no transparency behind the special session being called as no agenda has been shared.</p>
        <p>The new Parliament building, a prestigious project of the Modi government, was inaugurated by PM Modi on May 28 this year. Built at a total cost of ₹971 crore, the new parliament building can accommodate 888 members in the Lok Sabha and 300 members in the Rajya Sabha. The monsoon session of Parliament was held in the old building making the special session to be the first one in the new Parliament building.</p>

        <h1 id="a4">BCCI official makes no-holds-barred 'PCB leadership' revelation in brutal reply to Najam Sethi's dig at Asia Cup in SL</h1>
        <img src="./img/4.png">
        <p>Former PCB chair Najam Sethi was critical of the Asia Cup being co-hosted by Sri Lanka, owing to poor weather conditions in Pallekele.</p>
        <p>The rain threat loomed large over Asia Cup 2023 matches in Sri Lanka throughout the group stages. The highly-anticipated clash between India and Pakistan in the Asia Cup was marred by unrelenting rain, resulting in only one innings being played. Consequently, the match ended in a shared point scenario; India's final group game was also marred by rain but ensured a result as the side chased a revised target in a shortened affair in Pallekele. All three games in Sri Lanka so far have seen rain disrupting proceedings, leading to the Asian Cricket Council facing criticism over the scheduling of the tournament in the country.</p>
        <p>Sethi, in a post on social media platform X following the abandonment, stated that he had suggested United Arab Emirates as the venue for the marquee continental tournament. He stated that the suggestion was denied citing the hot weather conditions in the gulf country. “How disappointing! Rain mars the greatest contest in cricket. But this was forecast. As PCB Chair, I urged the ACC to play in UAE but poor excuses were made to accommodate Sri Lanka. Too hot in Dubai, they said. But it was as hot when the Asia Cup was played there last time in Sep 2022 or when IPL was played there in April 2014 and Sep 2020. Politics over sport. Unforgivable!” Sethi had written.</p>

        <h1 id="a6">Ameesha Patel says she lost Sanjay Leela Bhansali, SRK films due to her manager</h1>
        <img src="./img/6.png">
        <p>
            Ameesha Patel has said that her manager had differences with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and she did not even know about the offers from Sanjay, and YRF. <br>
            Ameesha Patel has now said that many A-list filmmakers, including Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Yash Chopra wanted to work with her but she lost out on those projects due to her manager. Ameesha was speaking with Siddharth Kannan in a new interview when she recalled how Sanjay once told her about being 'scared of her' due to her manager. (Also read: Films that made Sanjay Leela Bhansali a seven-time National Award winner) <br>
            Praising Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his personality, Ameesha said, “There were talks for a very good project. But I don’t want to mention its name, because the film has already been made. Unfortunately, my manager at that time and Mr Bhansali were not getting along. After I parted ways, amicably, with the manager, Bhansali sir told me that there were moments when we were supposed to work together but he did not want to deal with my manager. Even Yash Raj Films, Sajid Nadiadwala, and others told me later, 'we were too scared to approach you' because of the manager who used to be a barrier'. So, I missed out on numerous promising projects, directors, and producers due to mismanagement rather than proper management. But that’s destiny.” <br>
