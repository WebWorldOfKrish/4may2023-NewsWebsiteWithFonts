        <h1 id="a1">Simultaneous polls ideal, workable formula required: Law Commission draft report</h1>
        <img src="./img/1.png">
        <p>
            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal
        </p>
        <p>
            Holding simultaneous elections would be ideal as well as desirable, but a workable formula is required to be provided in the Constitution, the Law Commission of India concluded in its draft report in August 2018, citing detailed discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The report said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has supported the idea and projected logistical and financial requirements for conducting simultaneous elections. It added the ECI’s analysis of financial implications, logistical issues, the effect of the Model Code of Conduct, and constitutional and legal provisions point to the fact that there is a feasibility of restoring simultaneous elections as they existed during the first two decades of independence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Union government has constituted a panel led by former President Ram Nath Kovind to study the “one nation, one election” proposal. The panel will explore the feasibility and the mechanism of going back to having Lok Sabha and state assembly polls simultaneously. These polls were held together until 1967.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Law Commission called for appropriately addressing the issues of democracy, basic structure, federalism, etc. “Care has also been taken to ensure that the rights of the citizens are not compromised in any manner. Free and fair election is an essential part of a democracy. Even today, premature dissolution of House(s) and mid-term polls are frequent in the country.”

        <img src="./img/3.png">
        <p>Special Parliament session will be held in both the old and the new buildings. On Ganesh Chaturthi, the sitting will shift to the new Parliament building.</p>
        <p>Amid intense political speculations over the five-day special session of Parliament from September 18 to 22, it has now been reported that the session will begin in the old building and will later be moved to the new Parliament building on September 19, on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, news agency ANI reported citing sources. The special session of Parliament has caught the parties off guard as the government has not given any agenda for the 5-day sitting. Congress parliamentary party chief Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that there is no transparency behind the special session being called as no agenda has been shared.</p>
        <p>The new Parliament building, a prestigious project of the Modi government, was inaugurated by PM Modi on May 28 this year. Built at a total cost of ₹971 crore, the new parliament building can accommodate 888 members in the Lok Sabha and 300 members in the Rajya Sabha. The monsoon session of Parliament was held in the old building making the special session to be the first one in the new Parliament building.</p>
